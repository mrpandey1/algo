### Chat Bot

We just need to provide a message to a bot and then the bot will determine if the message is fake or not using our machine learning model and will send us the results

### Chrome Extension

You don't visit the website all time or send the message to the bot to determine if the content of the website is fake or real. You can just install our Fake News chrome extension and now you can check the news is fake or not directly in the browser tab.
